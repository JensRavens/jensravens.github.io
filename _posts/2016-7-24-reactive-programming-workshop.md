# Introduction to _Reactive Programming_ Workshop

This workshop will discuss what Reactive Programming means, why it doesn’t have to be functional and why everyone is so excited about the ideas behind it.

We will implement our own Observable together, see how observables can drive a UITableView and how networking code can be massively simplified using promises. The workshop finishes with a short tour about more advanced usages of observables like replacing storyboard navigation and advanced user flows.

Register for this seven hour workshop at [swissmobidevs.org](https://swissmobidevs.org/workshop-introduction-to-reactive-programming-with-interstellar-2/).
