# _Prototyping_ with _Storyboards_

Storyboards have grown in functionality over recent years and have become a great
tool for prototyping your next app idea. Designables are a great way to preview
the visual appearance of your app without starting the simulator and auto layout
can help you making prototypes for various form factors.

This talk was given at [Code Europe in Krakow and Warsaw](https://www.codeeurope.pl/en).
