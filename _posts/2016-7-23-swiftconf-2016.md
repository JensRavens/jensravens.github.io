# _Server Side_ Swift

Hooray, open source Swift finally arrived on Linux in December. Let's see how easy it is to use Swift for your backend and why Swift is a good choice for safe and fast development.

I will give this talk at [SwiftConf 2016 in Cologne](https://swiftconf.com).

Youtube and slides will be available after the talk.

If you still want to know more about the whole idea of server side swift you
can read my [blog post series on server side swift](/series/web-development-in-swift/).
