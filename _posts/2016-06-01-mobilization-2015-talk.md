# _Hipster Oriented_ Programming

Not sure if you should order a burrito or a monad for lunch? Get a quick
overview of Object Oriented, Functional and Protocol Oriented programming in
Swift 2 and learn what all that fuss is about and why you should care.

I gave this talk at [Mobilization 2015 in Lodz](http://2015.mobilization.pl/#speakers).

You can watch the full video at YouTube here:

If you still want to know more about the whole idea of monads you
can read my [blog post series on reactive programming](/series/functional-reactive-programming-in-swift/).
