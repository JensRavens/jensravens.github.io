# Introduction to _Reactive Programming_

Learn what Reactive Programming means, why it doesn’t have to be functional and why everyone is so excited about the ideas behind it.

We will implement our own Observable together, see how observables can drive a UITableView and how networking code can be massively simplified using promises.

I will give this talk at [Mobilization 2016 in Lodz](http://2016.mobilization.pl/#speakers).

Youtube and slides will be available after the talk.

If you still want to know more about the whole idea of monads you
can read my [blog post series on reactive programming](/series/functional-reactive-programming-in-swift/).
