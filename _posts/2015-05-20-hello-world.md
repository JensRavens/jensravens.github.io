# Hello _World_

Last week I've attended UIKonf. One of the amazing speakers there was
[Ash Furrow](http://ashfurrow.com) who talked about _Teaching and Learning_ and
how this experience helped him. In the end he had a taks for everyone in the
audience: Start a blog.

So here we go: I started by transforming my own talk _Functional Reactive
Programming without Black Magic_ into a series of blog posts you can find
[here](/series/functional-reactive-programming-in-swift).

Also based on Ash Furrows talk I've changed my process to _Open Source by
Default_, so you can find the whole blog at
[github](https://github.com/JensRavens/jensravens.github.io). If you find an
error I'm happy to accept pull requests üòÅ.
